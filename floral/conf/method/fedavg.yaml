# The default base config is FedAvg
#
# NOTE:
#   A better approach might be to put client, strategy, and trainer (incl, loss and reg) here,
#   so that we don't need to do method@_global_.
#   However, task would need to be on the global level as it overrides many of method's variables.
#   This can make more sense since methods are swept per task and tasks describe different experiments.
#
#   I've pondered this, but decided to just use @_global_ for both.
#   Putting tasks in the base directory will look messy.
#   If you need to use @_global_ for one guy, then might as well use it for the other.
